# Cleaning Boots with Saddle Soap User Story

Inspired by the Task #9 [here](https://www.ministryoftesting.com/articles/40bce49b?s_id=14525237) and [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7204kIPpxs) informative video


As an owner of boots that sometimes get dirty, I would like to be able to clean my boots with saddle soap so that they look good, are maintained properly and will last me long.
Dependencies of the story:
1) Tools needed: saddle soap (in a tin container with a lid), a circular horsehair shoe brush (or a sponge), microfiber cloth, shoe cream (or a conditioner)
2) Access to sink with a functioning faucet
3) Boots

Acceptance criteria:

- [ ] Boots should look clean (without any visible dirt) and moisturized on the outside

- [ ]	Soles should not have visible dirt or pebbles

- [ ] Boots with laces should be laced up according to a specification (but laces shouldn’t be tied)

- [ ] Boots shouldn’t look wet or have an unpleasant smell
