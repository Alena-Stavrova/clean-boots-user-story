**Epic: Clothing and Footwear Care**

As an owner of boots that sometimes get dirty, I would like to be able to clean my boots with a saddle soap so that they look good, are maintained properly and will last me long.

Dependencies of the story:
1) Tools needed: a saddle soap (in a tin container with a lid), a circular horsehair shoe brush (or a sponge), a microfiber cloth, a shoe cream (or a conditioner)
2) Access to a sink with a functioning faucet
3) Boots

Acceptance criteria:

- [ ] Boots should look clean (without any visible dirt) and moisturized on the outside

- [ ]	Soles should not have visible dirt or pebbles

- [ ] Boots with laces should be laced up according to a specification (but laces shouldn’t be tied)

- [ ] Boots shouldn’t look wet or have an unpleasant smell
